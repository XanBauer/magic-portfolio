## Why I Built My Data Science Portfolio

**Storytelling**. Storytelling and its importance is referenced relentlessly in the world of data professionals. Often, those stories are limited to LinkedIn profiles or resumes, but those rarely capture the full picture.

For years, I worked on complex data problems‚Äîbut where was the proof? Most of my work lived inside **company dashboards, python projects, or SQL queries**. When a recruiter or hiring manager asked, ‚ÄúWhat can you do?‚Äù the best I could offer was, **"Let me explain"** instead of **"Let me show you."**

I wanted a **place where my work could speak for itself.** A portfolio that would:

- **Make my technical work accessible to non-technical audiences**  
- **Show, rather than tell**  
- **Give recruiters and hiring managers an easy way to evaluate my skills**

## The Problem: My Work Wasn't Accessible

Most of my data science work exists inside professional environments, not something I can share. The public facing work I had published was in github repos, which are often intimdating for the uninitiated. My portfolio would bridge the gap and make my work accessible. 

## The Solution: A Portfolio That Shows My Work

A portfolio serves as:

- **Proof** of my skills
- **A way to communicate my work visually** rather than through explanations
- **A tool for recruiters/hiring managers** to evaluate me without requiring a full interview

## Balancing Learning & Launching

The challenge was that I wanted to learn some about web development, but I didn't want my portfolio to be delayed as I went through the learning journey. 

- **Avoiding perfectionism**: At some point, the portfolio had to be **good enough to launch**.

## Aesthetics

I wanted my portfolio to engage the viewer. Technical or not, I wanted people to feel relaxed and intrigued as the navigated the site. 

I used **design principles** to make my work feel **polished and professional**, ensuring:

- **Aesthetic breaks** so users aren‚Äôt overwhelmed by walls of text or complex charts.
- A clean, modern layout to keep things intuitive.

## Conclusion: The First Step in a Larger Journey

This portfolio is a living project and there will never be a final version.
