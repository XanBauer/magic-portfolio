## Overview

Using the Mayo Clinic Dataset, we create a model that predicts the presence of heart disease with over 90% accuracy

## Key Features

- **Results**: Tuned to 11% greater accuracy than the baseline average for logistic regression models
- **Relationships**: Discovered patterns between characteristics and the increased odds of having heart disease
- **Model Interpretation**: Results communicated in manner available to non-technical and technical audiences
- **Education**: Explanation of the math that supports logistic regression models

## Skills Used

- **EDA**: Exploratory Data Analysis for finding relationships worth exploring further
- **Logistic Regression**: For classifying the presence of heart disease.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid Search for finding the optimal model settings
- **ML & Stats Libraries**: scikit-learn, scipy, statsmodels, numpy, pandas
