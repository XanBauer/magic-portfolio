## How to Choose

When you choose the right tool for a job, your:

* **Work is faster**
* **Quality is higher**
* **Life is easier**

If you have worked on your yard or your car, you know the struggle that comes with missing the right tools. Often those tools are expensive and you don‚Äôt do that kind of work enough for the tool to pay for itself.

When I was making my portfolio, I had a different problem ‚Äî there were so many cost effective options. 

Which portfolio builder tool was the best for me?

## Recap
In my last post, I shared the inspiration and goals behind my portfolio. In this post, I explore my first challenge: getting started.

## Finding the right tool
I remember multiple home projects that would have been way easier with the right tool. Learning from my mistakes, I dedicated a Saturday afternoon to reviewing website builders and DIY solutions. When comparing tools, some of the questions I sought to answer were:

* How will this **show my work** to my audience?
* Will this cost **money or time**?
* What‚Äôs **important**?

## Overcoming Analysis Paralysis
With so many options, I found myself stuck, second-guessing every decision before even starting. 

Time melted away as I mulled over my notes and the sun dipped behind the neighbor‚Äôs house. Going to bed later that night, I realized I was focusing on the wrong questions. I should have been asking:

What‚Äôs the cost of choosing the **‚Äùwrong‚Äù** tool?
What‚Äôs the cost of **switching** tools?

By starting with free tools, the only real cost of choosing the wrong one was the time spent on the first version. Similarly, the cost of switching would be time migrating my code and designs from one tool to another, but no financial cost. 

The evidence pointed towards taking immediate action and iterating as needed.

## The actions I took and why

I started with a helpful guide from [Yu Dong](https://yudong-94.github.io/personal-website/blog/DataSciencePortfolio/) and created the first iteration on github pages with a Jekyll theme. After learning a little HTML and CSS, I was making progress on a customized version with enhanced interactivity.

After making some big wins on functionality, I sought the feedback of my running/data buddies (Richard Tran & Pierce Cohen) who taught me about Next.js and Vercel. The idea of switching to a new codebase was intimidating. Jekyll was simple, but it was limited on design and interactivity. On the other hand, Next.js allowed for dynamic components and improved performance. The upgrade felt worth the effort.

Working with ChatGPT, I built out a new Next.js site, deployed, and celebrated with drinks. But it was unpolished. I knew it could be better. Seeking inspiration and to stand on the shoulders of giants, I looked for next.js templates and found once-ui magic-portfolio (link here). THIS was what I had in mind. 

There were more challenges as I migrated my code base a second time, rebuilding functionalities and handling cascading changes, but I created the site you're on right now. I didn‚Äôt just build a portfolio ‚Äî I built a foundation for ongoing improvement. Each iteration taught me something new and helped me dream bigger. Now I have a portfolio that can evolve with my skills. 

## Conclusion and Key Takeaways
Even though I had to repeat work a couple of times, my portfolio and experience is stronger for it. I learned more about web development and Next.js, and I have a greater appreciation for what I made.

* If the costs are low, just start
* Experience is a strong teacher
* Aim for better, not perfect
