## Overview

Using the Mayo Clinic Dataset, we create a model that predicts the presence of heart disease with over 90% accuracy

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Extensive data cleaning, handling missing values, and normalizing data for accurate model predictions
- **k-Nearest Neighbors**: kNN algorithm to predict car prices on features and similar data points
- **k-Fold Cross-Validation**: Evaluates model performance, ensuring robust and reliable prediction
