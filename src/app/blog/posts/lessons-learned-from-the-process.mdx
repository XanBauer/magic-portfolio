# Lessons Learned From the Process

## Intro

### Building a portfolio from is more than a technical project. It provides opportunities to learn, problem-solve, prioritize, and respond to ambiguity.
Now that I’ve iterated through three major versions of my portfolio (Jekyll → raw Next.js → Magic Portfolio), I want to reflect on the lessons I learned—not just about code, but about how I work.
This post is about the takeaways I’ll carry into future projects, and the principles I now use to guide my creative and technical decisions.

## 1. Start Simple, Then Iterate

### At the start of this project, I thought the best way to avoid mistakes was to plan *everything*. But perfection is slow and stalls momentum. Meanwhile, plans can turn on a dime.
By starting small with Jekyll, I got something live. That first version was rough and barebones. But it created momentum. Each version after that was a natural evolution.
Lesson: Get moving. Don’t overthink the first step. A simple, working version is more valuable than a perfect plan that is quickly scrapped.

## 2.“Good Enough” Is sometimes the right answer

### There were many moments where I nearly got stuck trying to perfect a small detail, like how a heading lined up or animating a hover effect. These didn’t meaningfully improve the user experience and they drained time and energy I could’ve used on more impactful improvements.
Lesson: Be intentional with your effort. Not everything needs to be optimized or polished. Sometimes “done” is the upgrade.

## 3. Technical Skills Grow When you Use them with Purpose

### I didn’t set out to learn CSS or React, but I gained new skills in both because I needed them to make my site work.
When you learn in service of a goal, the concepts stick better. You’re solving real problems instead of memorizing syntax.
Lesson: Learn in context. A personally significant  project is better than theory and memorization.

## 4. Feedback is Fuel

### Some of my best improvements came from talking to friends and peers. When I shared my site with them, they didn’t hold back. Their input elevated the project far beyond what I could’ve done alone.
Lesson: Don’t wait until something is “done” to get feedback. Share early. Share often.

## 5. Version Control Isn’t Just for Code

### As I iterated, I learned the importance of keeping backups and documenting my changes; through Git, organized folders & files, and tracked tweaks.
At one point, I accidentally overwrote a working version of my blog layout and had to recreate it from memory. A painful lesson I will remember.
Lesson: Track your progress. Organization and version control protect your time and sanity.

## 6. There’s Power in Building Your Own Space

### This portfolio is a place where my voice, ideas, and skills live. It reflects who I am and where I want to go.
It's empowering. You don’t need permission to create something meaningful. You just need to begin.
Lesson: Don’t underestimate the value of owning your platform.

## Conclusion

### Projects like this are rarely just about the output. They’re about the process—the detours, the bugs, the breakthroughs, the growth.

I’m proud of what I’ve built. Not because it’s perfect, but because it’s me in progress. And I’ll carry these lessons forward in every project I contribute to next.

## Next Up

In my final post of the series, I’ll share what’s next:
*How I plan to continue evolving my portfolio
*What I’m excited to build next
*And the kind of opportunities I hope this work unlocks
