## Challenges. Challenges Everywhere

Every project has challenges ‚Äî some expected, some not so much. 

As I built my portfolio, I ran into obstacles that tested my patience, problem-solving skills, and ability to pivot.

In this post, I‚Äôll share the biggest technical hurdles I faced and how I overcame them.

## Recap

In my previous post, I discussed the importance of carefully choosing your tools. The right tool can introduce the challenge of a steeper learning curve. The wrong tool can introduce the challenge of more work to create a higher quality output. Let‚Äôs discuss how that played out here.

## Challenge 1: Migrating from Jekyll to Next.js

### The Problem

Jekyll is great for getting a simple portfolio up and running, but I sought more interactivity and polish. I decided to migrate to Next.js for a more modern and dynamic setup.

However, this wasn‚Äôt as simple as copying and pasting code. Jekyll and Next.js follow very different architectures:

* Jekyll is a **static site generator** using Markdown and Liquid templates.
* Next.js is a **React-based framework** that requires JavaScript and component-based development

I had to learn how to **move my content** while **restructuring the site** to align with Next.js‚Äô best practices.

### The Solution

I broke the migration into steps:
* **Rebuild the page structure** ‚Äì I converted Jekyll pages into React components and moved content into .tsx files.
* **Replicate styling** ‚Äì I adapted the existing CSS styles while experimenting with Tailwind CSS for a cleaner look.
* **Test deployment** ‚Äì After verifying that everything looked correct locally, I deployed and checked for issues.

This approach kept the transition manageable, and I was able to iterate on top of it rather than getting stuck in a massive, messy migration.


## Challenge 2: Handling image optimization in Next.js

### The Problem

At first, my images loaded inconsistently. Some were slow, some broke entirely, and some didn‚Äôt scale across devices.

The culprit? I was using standard \<img\> tags instead of Next.js‚Äô Image component (next/image), which optimizes images for better performance.

### The Solution

I replaced all \<img\> tags with the Next.js \<Image\> component, making sure to:
* Use the **width and height properties** to avoid layout shifts.
* **Enable lazy loading** to improve page speed.
* **Use dynamic imports** where needed to avoid unnecessary image requests.

This small change significantly improved load times and made my portfolio look more polished.

## Challenge 3: Fixing deployment issues on Vercel

### The Problem

I ran into an issue where the site **worked locally but failed on deployment**. 

For my first time working with Vercel, this was the kind of challenge I expected.

### The Solution

I debugged the problem by:
* **Checking logs on Vercel** ‚Äì This helped me pinpoint where dependencies were missing and variables misconfigured
* **Verifying package.json** ‚Äì I ensured all dependencies were correctly listed and installed.
* **Adding environment variables in Vercel‚Äôs dashboard** ‚Äì Some API keys weren‚Äôt being picked up correctly, so I had to set them manually in the project settings.

Once the fixes were in place, the deployment succeeded, and my site was live!

## Key Takeaways

Every technical challenge was a learning opportunity. Here‚Äôs what I took away from the process:
* üõ† **Break down big challenges** ‚Äì Migrating a site or fixing a deployment issue can feel overwhelming, but tackling it step by step makes it manageable.
* ‚ö° **Use the right tools** ‚Äì Learning about Next.js features like next/image and Markdown rendering saved me time and improved performance.
* üîç **Debug systematically** ‚Äì Checking logs and testing incrementally helped me quickly pinpoint and fix deployment issues.

## What's Next?
In my next post, I‚Äôll share some **lessons learned from this journey**‚Äîfrom balancing aesthetics with functionality to knowing when to refactor vs. move forward. Stay tuned!
